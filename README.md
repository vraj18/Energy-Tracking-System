# ⚡ Energy Tracking System for Smart Grids

**Duration:** January 2025 – February 2025  
**Tech Stack:** C/C++, B+ Trees, Linked Lists  

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Energy Tracking System** is a robust and efficient backend simulation tool designed to manage energy transactions within a smart grid environment. Built using advanced data structures like **B+ Trees** and **Linked Lists**, this system ensures fast, reliable, and scalable tracking of energy distribution between buyers and sellers.

The goal of the project is to simulate a decentralized, high-performance platform for recording energy exchanges while optimizing for retrieval, storage, and analysis operations.
